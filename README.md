  #### I've used two states *"items"* which is an array and another boolean state *"isLoaded* to get to know when the items have been loaded from the API

  #### *componentDidMount()* method to make API calls, inside that I've used fetch method to get the JSON data to save inside *"App* component, inside the state to reuse it inside the component.

   #### Took the states *"isLoaded" and "items"* inside the main function. *"isLoaded"* function will work while the data is loading and *"return()"* function will work once the JSON data loaded successfully.
